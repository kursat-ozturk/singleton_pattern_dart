# singleton_pattern_dart

Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one
instance and provides an easy global access to that instance.

## The main tenets of this pattern are:
- Ensure that the class has only a single instance.
- Provide easy global access to this instance.
- Control how it is instantiated.
- Any critical region must be entered serially.
